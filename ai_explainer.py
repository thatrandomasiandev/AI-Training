                "intermediate": "Stress is the internal force per unit area within a material when external loads are applied. Think of it as how much 'pressure' the material feels internally. We calculate stress by dividing the applied force by the cross-sectional area. If stress gets too high, the material can fail.",
                "advanced": "Stress (σ) is a tensor quantity representing the internal forces per unit area within a material continuum. It's defined as σ = F/A, where F is the applied force and A is the cross-sectional area. Stress analysis is fundamental to structural engineering, ensuring materials operate within their elastic limits and maintain adequate safety factors."

                "intermediate": "Deflection is the displacement or deformation of a structural element under load. It's how much a beam, column, or other structure moves from its original position when forces are applied. We limit deflection to ensure structures remain serviceable and don't cause discomfort or damage.",
                "advanced": "Deflection (δ) is the displacement of a structural element from its original position due to applied loads. It's calculated using beam theory equations, considering material properties (E, I), loading conditions, and boundary conditions. Deflection limits are typically L/250 to L/400 for beams, ensuring serviceability and preventing excessive deformation."

                "intermediate": "Safety factor is the ratio of the material's strength to the actual stress it experiences. It's a margin of safety that accounts for uncertainties in loading, material properties, and manufacturing. A safety factor of 2.0 means the material can handle twice the expected load before failing.",
                "advanced": "Safety factor (SF) is defined as SF = σ_allowable / σ_actual, where σ_allowable is the material's allowable stress and σ_actual is the calculated stress. It accounts for uncertainties in loading, material variability, manufacturing tolerances, and environmental factors. Typical safety factors range from 1.5 to 3.0 depending on the application and consequences of failure."

                "intermediate": "A moment is a rotational force that causes bending or twisting. It's calculated by multiplying the force by the distance from the point of rotation. In beam analysis, moments cause bending stress and deflection. The maximum moment usually occurs at the point of maximum stress.",
                "advanced": "Moment (M) is the product of force and perpendicular distance (M = F × d). In structural analysis, moments cause bending stress (σ = My/I) and deflection. Moment diagrams show how bending moment varies along a beam, with maximum values typically at supports or load points."

                "intermediate": "Young's modulus (E) is a measure of a material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation. It's the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region. Higher E means the material is stiffer and deforms less under the same stress. Steel has E ≈ 200 GPa, while aluminum has E ≈ 70 GPa.",
                "advanced": "Young's modulus (E) is the slope of the stress-strain curve in the elastic region, defined as E = σ/ε. It represents the material's stiffness and is a fundamental property in Hooke's law. E varies significantly between materials: steel (200 GPa), aluminum (70 GPa), concrete (30 GPa), and rubber (0.01 GPa)."
